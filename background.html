 <!-- Start of Key Features -->      
         <br>
         <h1>Key Features of Ride-Sharing Apps</h1>
          <p>Ride-sharing apps have been in demand lately. With the invention of the internet and the rise of mobile devices, ride-matching companies eventually migrated online. 
             Through mobile applications that can be downloaded via the internet and can be used almost anywhere, ride-sharing companies such as <i>Uber</i>, <i>Lyft</i>, 
             <i>GrabTaxi</i> have disrupted the ride-hailing field. Below are some key features of ride-sharing applications:</p>
        
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility</strong></li>
            <p>Anyone with an internet-enabled phone can download a ride-sharing app.  For android users, one can get it through Google Play Store and the Apple Store  for iOS users. 
               People with disabilities so as the elderly could even access key services in the app which are tailored for their needs (e.g. <i>UberASSIST</i> ).</p>
            <li><strong>Convenience</strong></li>
            <p>Another key feature of ride-sharing apps is its convenience. Compared to regular taxis which mostly involves hailing a cab on the streets, ride-sharing apps allow people to 
               book rides with just a few clicks. It even offers features such as advance price estimates and cashless in-app payment. Ride-sharing apps such as <i>Uber</i> and <i>Lyft</i> also offer services 
               such as split fare, multiple destinations, scheduled rides, and a variety of vehicle options and promotions depending on the customer’s budget and needs. They even have cancellation 
               features which could be accessed by both the driver and the passenger so as in-app driver tips and trip rating functions to assess customer experience.</p>
            <li><strong>Safety</strong></li>
            <p>Ride-sharing apps also offer features where one can share his or her location. <i>Uber</i> has a <i>“Share Your Trip”</i> function wherein one can send a trip data to 5 trusted contacts. <i>Lyft</i>, 
               on the other hand, has a <i>“Send ETA”</i> feature where one could send a text message with an in-app link to one’s current route and location. Both of these apps would also send driver 
               information, car details, and trip progress toward the destination.</p>
            <li><strong>Affordability</strong></li>
            <p>Ride-sharing apps themselves are usually free, however, the services they offer are the ones that users pay for. In the case of ride-sharing apps, <i>Uber</i> and <i>Lyft</i> in particular claim 
               that they are about 50% cheaper than a taxi and owning a car, though depending on the services and the time of day, their prices may rise due to high demand or may fall during lower times.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the average cost per mile for ride-sharing apps is about $2, with base rates ranging between $1 and $2 per mile compared to taxis which have a base rate of $2.60 and a distance 
               charge of $2.70 per mile. Moreover, according to <i>Statista.com</i>, a survey back in 2019 found that Uber, the cheapest ridesharing service, had an average cost of 25.37 U.S. dollars per ride while 
               a taxi, on the other hand, had 36.17 U.S. dollars per ride. Considering this, ride-sharing apps are indeed cheaper than hailing a taxi.</p>
          </ul>  
          
          <p>To further compare and contrast the key features of vehicles using ride-sharing apps and taxis, below is a table comparing the two:<p/>

 <!-- Start of Business Model -->           
          <h1>Business Model of Ride Sharing VS Taxi</h1>
          <p> Taxis has been operating since 1980. Taxi services are everywhere in the city that is operated by a company or an independent owner. Regarding rideshare services, the vehicle driver is commonly the owner as he/she drives his vehicle to earn money by driving passengers to a certain place.  
</p>
          <p>Rideshare vehicles customarily have a company sticker or logo as an identifier. For example, we can spot the Uber logo on all the cars operating this service. On the other hand, a taxi will typically possess a ‘taxi’ sticker or sometimes a sticker of the company that owns it. 
 </p>

          <p>Almost all ridesharing companies require their drivers to take pieces of training before they can start working with them in order to teach the various security precautions, rules, etiquettes, etc. For taxi services and drivers, ought to be licensed by the government authority like LTO (Land Transportation Office) in order for them to operate in a specific city or town.
 </p>
          <p>Taxi and ridesharing services have middlemen. The app owner companies like Uber and other ridesharing services are the middlemen who charge a fee from the drivers’ profits in trade for their services. The taxi owner or company owner can be the middleman where they may charge a percentage from the drivers for letting them utilize the taxi unit/s.
 </p>
          <p>Talking about the schedule, taxi drivers usually work fixed turns and do not hold so enough flexibility. On the other hand, Ride-share drivers, possess the flexibility to work, they are free to work anytime they want.
 </p>   
          <p>They have different ways how to get their service. Rideshare services operate by means of mobile applications, in which a rider can book a vehicle. The driver is notified that someone is needing their service through the app and he will arrive and pick up the passengers at the requested location. With this application, passengers can also trace the driver’s location while waiting.

 </p>
          <p>In contrast, taxi services usually operate through phone calls and straight hailing, where usually a passenger has to wait on the road and make a sign to stop a taxi or call a taxi company asking to send a taxi to pick them up at the requested address.

 </p>
          <p>Pricing is a big part of taking a taxi or rideshare services. Taxis charge per kilometer when moving and charge per minute while it is not in motion. In a different manner, rideshare services charge per kilometer and per minute, despite whether they are in motion or not and with some exclusions.
